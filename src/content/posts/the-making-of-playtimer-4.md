This week in coding Playtimer - The pressure is on as I wrestle through unforseen challenges and plan to deal with new ones.

### Where were we?

_If you want to check it our, read up on the progress I've made in [The Making of Playtimer (Part 1)](https://anthonyjmedina.com/posts/the-making-of-playtimer-1.md/), and [The Making of Playtimer (Part 2)](https://anthonyjmedina.com/posts/the-making-of-playtimer-2.md/), and [The Making of Playtimer (Part 3)](https://anthonyjmedina.com/posts/the-making-of-playtimer-3.md/)._

Last week I stood toe to toe with blockers that stood between me and bringing this project to it's initial conclusion (apps can always be improving) - mainly, providing feedback for my users to know when a timer was active and inactive and or expired, without using a Progress Bar Component. In the end, I decided to plan and create variant states (as one does in Figma) of the timers to render when various conditions were met.
