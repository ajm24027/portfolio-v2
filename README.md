## Why make a new portfolio?

My older portfolio was fine for what it was doing, and in most cases, had a lot more character. However, it no longer served me. As I move on from UX Design, and move more towards UX Engineering, and Software Engineering, I needed something that would allow me to record my journey, quickly allow recruiters to view my projects, and link them to my socials where they can contact and learn more about me. Which, to be honest, portfolio-v1 kind of did, but not in a way that was organized, unified, or dynamic.

## The New Portfolio

My new portfolio will allow me to solve a few problems:

1. **Record my journey** - I initially wanted to create a portfolio that was bisected, to provide a way for recruiters to see my SWE work and my UX Design work. But after speaking with my team, They've convinced me that it would be better to just show my Design Thinking, and how I'm incorporating UCD and Usability Fundamentals in my work. So, after shopping around the internet, I landed on a blog, and plan to post about new projects, featured projects, and other things I'm working on, and discuss my thoughts on the design of the thing. This will create content for me on my social media, and hopefully, recruiters see this as social proof of my design and engineering skills.

2. **Quickly allow recruiters to view my projects** - My old portfolio was already doing this, but on my old portfolio, I felt obligated to use various pages as case studies, but they were often shoddy and superfluous, like, I was only adding them because the cool hover effect was already there. This is what led me to step 1, above. Additionally, with the framework I chose, any project I add is going to be rendered dynamically rather than me having to go in and code a new card and page.

3. **Link to my socials to learn and contact more about me** - Old Portfolio was also doing this. But recreating the portfolio did give me the chance to decide which socials I should tailor and which were most important to me.

## Did I learn anything from making this?

I did get the chance to work with a new Javascript framework called [Astro](https://astro.build/), that I've just learned is similar to SSG's in that blog posts and pages and such can be written in Markdown, which is really cool - being that Markdown is easy to write, and all of the content is rendered to HTML. The value comes from the speed and optimization that the platform boasts and the number of SEO tools that come packaged with the framework.
